Q: Can you think of an analogy between the process of tesselating hexagons and randomly generating a world using rooms and hallways? 
What is the hexagon and what is the tesselation on the Project 3 side?

A: hexagon is the unit of my world and shape the world and tessellation is drawing(?) or filling the space with hexagons. 

-----
Q: If you were to start working on world generation, what kind of method would you think of writing first? 
Think back to the lab and the process used to eventually get to tesselating hexagons.

A: initialize the tile rendering and create a two dimentional array.


-----
Q: What distinguishes a hallway from a room? How are they similar?

A: they are connected and have walls that are visually distinct from floor. Rooms have random width and height but hallways have random length. 

-----
Q: For tesselating hexagons, one of the hardest parts is figuring out where to place each hexagon/how to easily place hexagons on screen in an algorithmic way. 
After looking at your own implemention, consider the implementation provided near the end of the lab. 
How did your implementation differ from the given one? What lessons can be learned from it?

A: I did not give proper order/ direction to move. 

-----
Q: Consider an algorithm for placing rooms and hallways on your map. 
Ideally, consider many algorithms and think about what makes some easier or harder to implement. Try and bring those ideas together into a single simple algorithm which accomplishes the task. 
In general, algorithms with as few edge cases as possible are better algorithms.

A: generate a room with random width and height and then generate a hallway with random length but in restricted coodination (within the width).
